# Sa11y
Sa11y is an accessibility quality assurance tool that visually highlights common accessibility and usability issues. Geared towards content authors, Sa11y indicates errors or warnings at the source with a simple tooltip on how to fix.

Sa11y works as a simple in-page checker that is designed to be easily customized and integrated into any content management system (CMS) to facilitate good accessibility practices. Sa11y works best in a templated CMS environment, although can also work as a bookmarklet. Sa11y is not a comprehensive code analysis tool.
- Over 30 test conditions.
- Easy, intuitive tooltips to explain issues.
- Free and open source.
- No complex API or integrations.
- Simple rule sets.
- Easily customizable: add your own rulesets.
